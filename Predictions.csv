Of course, being cats, they took to frottage instantly, but encouraging them to perform oral, let alone mutual oral, proved to be very challenging,” said zoologist Mason Shubaly, whose team tried numerous strategies from simply providing the big cats with soft lighting and sensual music to more radical techniques such as having zookeepers demonstrate the act. However, it was years before they could inspire the timid animals to “loop-the-loop.” “Zoos across the world have been attempting this feat for years, but it takes a combination of proper atmosphere, a bit of coordination, and the right kind of coaxing to get tigers to, shall we say, engage. In the end, we used a harness to slowly lower the male tiger into the enclosure as the female was restrained upside down, and now our greatest challenge is getting them to stop sixty-nining all the time. I haven’t been this excited since we got the baboons to eat ass.” While Shubaly admitted that much work has to be done, the tigers were already displaying vast improvements in their willingness and ability to perform reverse cowgirl.",zoologists thrilled after successfully getting pair of bengal tigers to 69 in captivity,zoologists finally get tigers to 69 in captivity

We’d invariably end up with several missing parts, and we could only speculate about what might have filled them. But now, we can safely say that these empty spaces were most likely filled with other bits of rock.

258,"WASHINGTON—In light of increased pressure on   to order a military strike on Syria, leading historians and military experts on Tuesday simply pointed to the United States’ longstanding and absolutely impeccable record of successful bombing campaigns over the past 60 years. “The record clearly shows that, in every instance since the Second World War in which the U.S. government has launched strategic missile attacks on foreign soil, our military forces easily targeted enemy assailants with total precision, leaving no civilian casualties, collateral damage, or any long-term negative consequences for the affected country or region, American foreign policy, or international relations as a whole,” said Harvard University historian Dr. Michael Carmona, adding that such past U.S. bombing operations have gone particularly well in Middle Eastern countries over the last century. “Just look at the 1954 bombings in Guatemala, the 1965-to-1973 bombings in Laos and Cambodia, the 1982 bombings in Beirut, the 1986 bombings in Libya, the 1987 bombings in Iran, the 1998 bombings in Iraq, the 1998 bombings in Sudan, the 1998 bombings in Afghanistan, routine airstrikes in Pakistan since 2005, the 2007 bombings in Somalia, the 2011 bombings in Somalia, and essentially the entire American military effort in Vietnam from 1960 to 1975. Those were all executed perfectly, and led, in the long run, to the most desirable possible outcome.” All experts on the subject then agreed unanimously that, if you want to create positive and lasting change in a troubled region, change that you will one day look back on with a deep sense of confidence, pride, and assurance that you did the right thing, then bombing campaigns are almost always the way to go.","experts point to long, glorious history of successful u.s. bombing campaigns",historians: u.s. bombing campaigns have gone well over 60 years

This missing link could be the key to understanding how a small-time cable star or bit player in films might, over time, evolve the traits of superstardom and eventually emerge to dominate the box office.

Beyond that, the only other material change that is likely to result from Obama calling on elected officials and everyday citizens to work together to reduce gun violence will be the purchase of roughly 100 million rounds of ammunition.” Bieler noted that the president’s support for responsible gun ownership will likely have no impact on sales, as Americans would have likely already walked out of their front door, started their car, and driven to their nearest gun store long before that point in the speech.",report: increase in gun sales to be most concrete result of obama's pro-gun-control speech,report: increase in gun sales most concrete result of obama's pro-gun

In some cases, healthcare will even be low-priced enough to afford using only the income from a part-time side job on the weekends.

In the words of Donald Trump, our country is a disaster.” Once again echoing the pronouncements of president-elect Trump, Leidecker noted that we sadly won’t be able to rely on Washington to change anything, as our political system is largely run by self-serving, power-hungry factionalists who don’t have the best interests of common Americans at heart.",report: things finally as bad as trump claims,u.s. conditions finally as bad as trump has long claimed

550,"WASHINGTON—An alarming report released Thursday by researchers at the Economic Policy Institute confirmed that, following a generation of dwindling economic opportunities and stagnant wages, the American middle class is now running dangerously low on things it can be squeezed out of. “Based on our findings, the nation is heading toward a disastrous point in the next decade at which there will no longer be a single facet of our economy from which middle- class families can be further squeezed,” said lead researcher Bryan Shale, adding that having already squeezed middle-income Americans out of job security, access to bank loans, high-quality education, retirement investing, and home ownership, the U.S. had nearly exhausted its already limited supply of squeezable sectors. “Perhaps most distressing is that given how rapidly the middle class has been driven from upward mobility and reliable healthcare, the few areas left to squeeze them out of are negligible at best. We’re scraping the bottom of the barrel here if the ability to shop at premium supermarkets, have museum memberships, or take weekend getaways is all that remains. Unless lawmakers take immediate action, we’re talking about the real possibility of a world in which the middle-class squeeze as we know it is complete, and the majority of Americans can be squeezed no further.” The researchers confirmed, however, that the U.S. middle class is still reliably being hit from all sides.",report: middle class running dangerously low on things to be squeezed out of,report: middle class running dangerously low on things it can be squeezed out of

In his new high-stress, low-reward position, Obama will be charged with such tasks as completely overhauling the nation's broken-down economy, repairing the crumbling infrastructure, and generally having to please more than 300 million Americans and cater to their every whim on a daily basis. As part of his duties, the black man will have to spend four to eight years cleaning up the messes other people left behind. The job comes with such intense scrutiny and so certain a guarantee of failure that only one other person even bothered applying for it. Said scholar and activist Mark L.

If Trump is masturbating on a flag anywhere other than Arlington, or if he does not ejaculate directly on Old Glory, we will continue to stand behind him. And if fewer than 100 eyewitnesses see him engaged in the masturbation, we will dismiss it as hearsay.

Not only did we have to deal with all of Mr. Cohen’s disorganized bullshit, as well as his pretty shocking lack of knowledge on how regulatory reform actually works, but we also were never sure how much of our money was actually being used to influence the administration’s policy-making.

Several key sponsors have already pulled their support from the network, and given how far beyond the pale this truly was, I very much doubt that even an apology from the show’s creators will be enough to quell the public backlash.” Atkinson said he hopes that, at the very least, the incident will help spark a national dialogue on violence in the media and in American culture at large.",tv show under fire for depicting murder,'criminal minds' critics for 'act of murder' episode

Furthermore, the pasta can be safely served hot as an entree or cold in a salad, and manufacturers have full approval to produce it without any restrictions regarding use of white flour, wheat flour, or a tricolor mix.” Ostroff cautioned, however, that the new pasta shape was at this time only approved for pairing with a light-bodied red wine.

We’d invariably end up with several missing parts, and we could only speculate about what might have filled them. But now, we can safely say that these empty spaces were most likely filled with other bits of rock.

""Thank you, and may God bless America,"" said the clearly insecure president, who, by seeking the aid of an imaginary being who is neither his ancestor nor someone with whom he shares a tangible harmonious relationship, freely admitted that he has little faith in himself and his inept team of jester advisers.  Even more incomprehensible, sources said, is that hundreds of millions of Americans openly worship the all-knowing invisible man—who apparently observes the world's events from atop his perch in outer space—without fear of mockery, shame, or violent government reprisal.

Unable to recapture their initial excitement, several of our study’s participants reported feelings of emptiness that no gift basket of skin-care products or Rachael Ray cookbook could ever seem to fill.” Nelson added that more than half of past bingo winners end up returning to the same dank, fluorescent-lit community centers and church basements where they started—often on the very next Thursday night.",study finds 70% of bingo winners end up prizeless within 5 years,study finds 7 out of 10 bingo winners end up prizeless within 5 years

Moreover, supervisors who referred to their staff as ‘one big family’ were much more likely to keep loyal employees for years or even decades, in some cases retaining experienced and dedicated workers until just before their retirement benefits kicked in, at which point said workers were either laid off or pruned away during a sudden corporate relocation to the Midwest.” Mahoney’s team also found that companies which failed to circulate an end-of-year note were 87 percent more likely to shut down in the subsequent year.    ",report: greatest factor in employee retention boss sending out end-of-year note titled 'thanks team',report: workplaces with highest employee retention rate more likely to keep employees in stable

The Founding Fathers recognized that the heart belongs to the tides and the deep alone—in both stormful days and calm waters.” Alito went on to say that marriage between a man and the sea must be preserved as such despite the fact that she can be a cruel mistress with little heed for what a forsaken old sailor wills.",lonesome alito declares marriage only between a man and the sea,supreme court justice alito declares marriage only exists between man and sea

After deftly scaling an exterior fire escape on the Apostolic Library, the pontiff is said to have raced across the pitched roof of the Vatican Museums while closely trailing the fleeing commandment violator, who according to eyewitnesses looked back over his shoulder multiple times during the pursuit to find the white-clad Vicar of Christ just a dozen paces behind him. Reports indicate that the pope lost track of the transgressor against God on top of the Palace of the Canonicate, causing him to pause for several seconds and frantically scan the horizon in all directions before suddenly spying the man on the adjacent roof of the Church of Santa Maria della Pietà, at which point the Bishop of Rome is said to have dashed at full speed to the building’s ledge and leapt the 30-foot gap separating the two structures. Sources confirmed that after a tumbling landing, the pope quickly picked himself up, returned his mitre to his head, and immediately resumed the chase.

1298,"WASHINGTON—Telling reporters he needed to get his “digs back into primo condition” as quickly as possible, Vice President Joe Biden was seen scrambling around Friday morning in a frantic attempt to clean up Number One Observatory Circle just hours before his successor was scheduled to move into the residence. Biden, who said he needed to get the place “real fucking clean” because the incoming resident was a “total tightass,” reportedly spent his last remaining moments in the home darting from room to room prying Keystone Light cans and empty bottles of Jose Cuervo from the sticky wooden floors and tossing them into heavy-duty black plastic trash bags. According to sources, the vice president paused frequently to sniff the Colonial- and Federal-style furnishings, spraying an aerosol disinfectant on anything that smelled “iffy.” “I thought the casa might need a little tune-up before I gave back the keys, but this is way more of a shitstorm than I bargained for,” said the outgoing vice president, who then opened a second-story window to hurl out a heavily stained 200-year-old rug that was a gift from the British ambassador Viscount Halifax. “Truth be told, I’m not even sure how it got fucked up so bad. I guess Dynamite Joe must’ve raged harder than I remember.” “I’ll do my best to give the place a good scrubdown, but I can’t guarantee there won’t be a few ‘souvenirs’ left over from my time in the saddle,” continued Biden, picking out shards of a broken lava lamp from the cushions of a damask settee that was draped in several large beach towels to hide its numerous cigarette burns. “Shit, clock’s a-ticking. I better get a move on.” According to aides, Biden crammed several embroidered drapes into the 123-year-old home’s washing machine, sprinted into the kitchen, where he dumped an entire bottle of detergent into a sink overflowing with Lenox china, and then left the faucet running as he grabbed a piece of coarse steel wool and turned his attention to buffing out the words “Ratt” and “Crüe,” which had been carved in large letters into the decorative molding of his dining room chair rail. The winded and perspiring vice president was reportedly later seen hurrying around the residence, using a piece of cardboard torn off a Cutco knives box to sweep an array of peanut shells, old scratch-off tickets, half-empty packets of ramen noodles, and Kameleon-brand condom wrappers under various armoires and antique couches. According to reports, Biden then rushed to move a dresser originally belonging to Aaron Burr in front of a hole that he said had been punched in the wall by “one of Arne Duncan’s douchebag pals” during his 2010 State of the Union after-party. Sources confirmed that Biden worked incessantly throughout the morning, pausing only to crank up Warrant’s “Cherry Pie” on a battered boombox he had propped up on a chair in the reception hall. “Ain’t got time for dicking around, since I still have to figure out what shit I’m taking and what I’m gonna hawk to the new suckers,” said Biden as he furiously sifted through a pile of his best “wank mags,” before tossing a weathered 1982 issue of  Fling  into a box labeled “Keepers.” “And as for the rest of this fancy crap, they say it’s all property of the Navy, but I’m sure as hell ganking a flat-screen TV or two.” “I did my time helping Barry take care of business—nothing wrong with making it worth my while,” the vice president added. When pressed on his moving van’s arrival time, Biden revealed he had declined the government’s contracted moving company in favor of his buddies Paco and Skuzz, with whom he reportedly went “way the fuck back.” The vice president admitted that while the two men weren’t professional movers, they had lots of experience handling “valuables” and could be trusted to look the other way at his “office supplies,” including roughly four and a half pounds of “some real dank Bubba Kush.” Additionally, Biden said he could use any extra time to scrub the carpet in the sitting room, where he had done a significant amount of spray-painting while souping up a red 1979 Harley-Davidson Electra Glide that he repeatedly referred to as his “cherry chariot.” “It blows that I have to spend my last few hours here cleaning up instead of savoring all the good times we had livin’, lovin’, and rockin’ our sacks off,” said Biden, who decided to leave behind a prized butterfly sex swing for the incoming second family. “Besides, what’s the point? I’m gonna end up tossing most of this stuff in the trashola anyway.” “Except the twins,” the six-time Delaware senator continued, tucking a Budweiser-brand, life-size cutout of two scantily clad cowgirls under his arm. “They’re coming with Uncle Joe.”",biden frantically cleaning up trashed vice president residence at last second,biden scrambling around in frantic attempt to clean up number one observance circle

1361,"HOUSTON—Gathering to celebrate a milestone that many throughout the country had long eagerly awaited, an estimated 150,000 cheering citizens packed into a public park in downtown Houston Wednesday night to hear Ted Cruz confirm his campaign for president of the United States was over, sources reported. Major roadways were reportedly closed to traffic in anticipation of the event, and a jubilant crowd poured into the streets, swarming Discovery Green in hopes of witnessing the historic moment in person. Sources noted a mood of giddy anticipation spreading through the park as the tightly packed throngs waited expectantly for Cruz to take the stage and announce he was bringing his presidential bid to an end. “I’ve been dreaming about this moment since the first time I heard Ted Cruz speak, and I just had to be here to see it happen,” said Kevin Chavis, a voter who drove nearly nine hours from Memphis, TN to hear the 45-year-old senator publicly state that while he was proud of all he had accomplished, he did not see a way forward for his campaign at this time. “I’m going to remember this day for the rest of my life!” “We were all so excited watching the numbers come in and realizing this was finally going to happen,” Chavis added. “Words can’t express how happy I am right now.” Witnesses told reporters the park was teeming with people who shouted out in celebration, exchanged high-fives, hugged complete strangers, danced, and spontaneously broke out into choruses of “God Bless America.” According to those present, several vendors were selling commemorative merchandise, a brass band played, and a sense of euphoria took hold as revelers waited for the moment when a chastened, sober-faced Cruz would step to the podium and concede the failure of his candidacy. One audience member remarked that she had taken her children out of school for the day so they could attend the speech, saying the experience would be one her boys would always be able to look back on with fondness and pride.  “My kids just had to be here—I mean, this is one of the most important moments in American history,” said Martha Dorsey, who hoisted her 6-year-old son up onto her shoulders so he would be able to see the former White House hopeful’s face without a trace of its usual self-assured grin. “This is something they’re going to tell  their  kids about one day. They’ll say, ‘I was there the day Ted Cruz’s presidential campaign ended. I saw him up there holding back tears!’ How special is that?” Thousands of cameras reportedly flashed as Cruz appeared and walked across the stage, his gaze directed downward. Sources said that upon reaching the podium, the senator was forced to wait nearly 10 minutes for the cheering to die down before he could start speaking. When he finally began his speech, opening with the words “I am suspending my campaign,” the audience erupted once more into thunderous applause. Reports confirmed that large screens erected throughout the park allowed even those hundreds of yards away to watch the man shift uncomfortably and choke up as he thanked his campaign team for its hard work. When Cruz stated that he would be returning home immediately to spend time with his family, tens of thousands of people were seen breaking into smiles and throwing their arms around one another, unable to contain their joy. “After Iowa, I really never thought this would happen,” said Houston resident Leslie Kemp, who wiped away a tear as she looked up at the slump-shouldered, visibly crestfallen figure on the stage. “But everyone came together, and we made it happen. It’s easy to be cynical about politics, about the state of our democracy. But seeing Ted Cruz up there announcing that he’s bowing out of the race—it made me proud of my country.” “I have real hope for the future now,” Kemp added. “We are finally headed in the right direction.”",thousands of cheering americans packed into park for ted cruz concession speech,"'i just had to be here to see it happen,' says cheering te"

1387,"JACKSON HOLE, WY—A team of doctors responsible for the care of Dick Cheney revealed Thursday that for the past few years, the former vice president has burned through a minimum of three hearts every week. “Within a time span of 48 hours or so, Mr. Cheney generally exhausts his heart until it is totally unusable, at which point he comes in for a fresh heart transplant to get him through the next few days,” said cardiac surgeon Dr. Anthony Griener, noting that when a spent heart is pulled from Cheney’s thoracic cavity, it generally emerges smoldering, shriveled, and completely black, at times also secreting a corrosive, viscous brown liquid. “He’s had so many transplants at this point that we no longer even have to apply general anesthesia or make a new incision for the procedure. He comes in, we chat with him for a bit while we pry open his chest, and we insert a fresh heart. Then he’s on his way.” Doctors also revealed that Cheney is thriving under these conditions and will likely continue to live for many, many, many years to come.",doctors reveal dick cheney burning through at least 3 hearts each week,cheney burns through 3 hearts every week

Which is great, because KIND was really struggling as a maker of particleboard furniture until someone figured out you could eat these things.” Lubetzky also revealed that six new strains of KIND bar have begun to materialize just in time for the holidays.",kind bar ceo admits they just sort of find the bars like that,kind bar employees just sort of find the bars like that

I’ll get it for you,” before winning it, the couple had a 94 percent chance of reporting high levels of emotional, intellectual, and sexual fulfillment. “In addition, the size of the stuffed animal won for a wife was extremely accurate in predicting levels of satisfaction, with smaller prizes like rubber finger puppets or plastic backscratchers resulting in higher incidences of dissatisfaction and divorce.” The report added that if on the way home from a fair a husband tenderly placed his jacket over his wife’s shoulders, statistics indicated they would die of old age on the very same day.",report: only predictor of happy marriage is if husband ever won wife big stuffed animal at amusement park,report: sole predictor of successful marriage is whether or not husband ever won big stuffed animal

Much of the U.S. populace will have to settle for relatively cheaper options such as milk and tap water for the time being, which will undoubtedly have a major impact on their internal combustion.” Sharpless concluded the statement with a recommendation that such consumers supplement their diets with the naphthenes and cycloalkanes found in most commercial plastics.",soaring gas prices forcing more americans to drink less gas,fda confirms soaring gas prices forcing more americans to decrease daily gas intake

However, those who didn’t were more prone to lag far behind their peers and often died at the hands of a bloodthirsty, vengeful succubus.” Greenwood added that while knowing Latin provided students certain advantages in summoning demons, it had absolutely zero bearing on their ability to send them back to Hell when they were done.",report: students who take latin have better chance of summoning demon later in life,report: students who take latex have better chance of summoning demon later in life

We will show these terrorists that they can’t hide from the next president of the United States.” At press time, a Rubio campaign airstrike intended for ISIS had accidentally hit a group of Ted Cruz loyalist fighters outside Tikrit.","rubio campaign deploys 6,000 ground troops to combat isis","rickie roubio deploys 6,000 ground troops to fight isis"

In fact, just one acre of our new corn is able to bankrupt as many family farmers as 10 acres of our previous formula.

Then we discovered a clip with some of the very same men sharing a spaghetti dinner in a luxurious prison cell, which was perhaps the best evidence to date that these were no isolated sequences, but components in what could quite possibly be a feature-length film.” Carnevale went on to say that despite the many clear connections among  Goodfellas  YouTube clips, no direct associations were as yet found between them and the  Matrix  recommendations in the sidebar.",historians suggest 'goodfellas' youtube clips may be fragments of larger work,historians suggest each goodfellas clip might be fragments of larger artistic work

For example, while he wasn’t able to convince any elk to become his disciples and go out to spread the word of God, he did succeed in his primary goal of granting elk everlasting life when he was eventually trampled to death for their sins.” Charow noted that the text further suggests Jesus will one day return to earth to judge the living and the dead elk as a warmup for the actual End Times.",new biblical text reveals god first sent christ to save elk as practice,newly discovered first-century text reveals god first sent christ to save elk as

And even then, we probably should have added some sort of fail-safe against accidental activation, like a flip box over the button or an additional feature that would cancel the 10-second countdown, which we did not think to include.” Muilenburg added that the recent oversights had prompted the company to also remove the self-destruct buttons from first class seating in all Boeing jets after several passengers had mistaken them for the flight attendant call button.",boeing ceo admits company made mistake by including automatic self-destruct function on all 737 max planes,"'it probably wasn't the best idea,' says bobby mcd"

Now, after extensive research, we’ve found the precise location of the brain where all human follicles grow from,” said lead neuroscientist Dr. Avi Samuel, confirming the long-debated hypothesis that patients who experience baldness may have underdeveloped prefrontal lobes or have suffered irreversible brain damage. “Initially, we had to admit that we had no idea where human hair came from. Of course, we firmly rejected the old superstition that hair grew forth from the soul, but we honestly couldn’t come up with a better explanation. But after months of scans, we can now confirm that at the onset of puberty, this fertile region of the human cerebrum kicks into overdrive, sprouting as much body hair as possible, and maintains this follicular capacity throughout the human lifespan.” The research study further suggests that memories may be stored in each individual strand of hair, providing yet another reason why it may be dangerous to attempt to cut your own hair.",scientists pinpoint part of brain all your hair grows out of,scientists discover part of brain all your hair grows out of

1866,"DURHAM, NC—According to a study published Monday by researchers at Duke University’s Center for Cognitive Neuroscience, humans experience the most intense feelings of happiness when pressing the “skip ad” button before watching a video on the internet. “After measuring test subjects’ endorphin and serotonin levels during a variety of pleasurable activities, we found that the largest spikes in joy were recorded when participants stopped an online advertisement and initiated the video they actually wanted to watch,” said the study’s lead author, Dr. Paul Alleslev, who noted that feelings of bliss began rising as the timer indicating how soon the button would appear counted down toward zero. “Also, using fMRI scans, we noticed that once the ‘skip ad’ box became visible, the pleasure centers of the brain lit up with a flurry of activity, as did the motor cortex, prompting subjects to click the button with extraordinary speed as soon as it appeared onscreen.” Alleslev added, however, that humans appeared to experience the most acute feelings of rage after they’d watched enough videos that the “skip ad” option was no longer available.",new study finds humans experience greatest feelings of joy when pushing 'skip ad' button,study: humans experience most intense feelings of happiness when pressing 'skip ad' button

The Labrador retriever mix—who bypassed a series of nearly perfect spots to deposit his feces—scanned the ground for a full seven minutes before eventually locating the 4-by-5-inch region that exhibited an ideal synthesis of ground texture, smell, and plant-life proximity. Sigmund then carefully strained out two and one quarter lengths of excrement onto the ideal site, approximately 11 inches from the curb and 4 inches from a street sign soaked in another dog's urine. This marked Sigmund's most successful location hunt today, surpassing an earlier incident in which the dog found a pretty okay place to vomit.",dog finds absolutely perfect place to shit,"dog finds perfect place to squat down on hind legs, void bowels"
